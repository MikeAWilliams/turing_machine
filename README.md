# Motivation
I am reading the excelent ["The annotated Turing" by Charles Petzold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Annotated_Turing). This project contains an emulator for a Turing Machine. 

So far I have only written enough code to satisfy Turing's first three machines. I plan to add an enterpreter which converts tables in the notation Turing into the functions I am using.
